/*
    For this section of the assessment you will be putting together a cheat sheet for common git commands.

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////

//CODE HERE
let gitDefinition = 'Online versions of a file to revert back to if needed, with the ability to check other branches of the project that you have created. '
//////////////////PROBLEMS 3 - 8////////////////////
/*
    For the next several problems you will be creating objects containing information about different git 
    commands.  Each object should contain 'description' and 'code' properties.  The 'description' property 
    will be a string with a description of what that git command does.  The 'code' property should be a 
    string of the actual command (what you type into your terminal).
*/

//////////////////PROBLEM 3////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'init' with 'description' and 'code' properties 
    following the guidelines above to describe the init command.

*/

//CODE HERE
let status = {
    description: 'Checks the current status of the git branch',
    code: 'git status'
}
//////////////////PROBLEM 6////////////////////
/*

//CODE HERE
let add = {
    description: 'adds file to the staged changes section of git that will update when committed.',
    code: 'git add <file>'
}
//////////////////PROBLEM 7////////////////////
/*
    Create an object called 'commit' with 'description' and 'code' properties
